# Put any paths in here to match the paths contained in markdown-pages/src
# This is because our markdown pages will be build into next.js pages, and
# they will mirror the same folder/file tree structure as in markdown-pages/src
pages/docs

# This is generated by the markdown pages build script. It will contain a meta
# json object that describes the structure of our dynamic pages. This is useful
# in runtime as we can use it to build a directory list / menu component for
#Â example.
